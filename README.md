# Flight-Info-Application
This simple web application serves you with distance and flight time calculations between airports and delivers some other handy information to plan your flight!


*** DESCRIPTION *** 
Hi there, thanks for chekcing out!

This is my first app made using Spring, be lenient :) 

The app allows logged users to choose two locations (airport) and retrieve some useful data to plan their flight. User selects departure/arrival airport
codes, provides speed and the app returns details including estimated flight time & distansce + current weather information for both locations. 
All user entries are stored and user can review or delete them.

A simple admin panel is also set. The Admin can delete user accounts and stored flight plans of each user. Admin may also update the list
of available airports by sending a request to an external API. 

Bare in mind this is a pre-beta :) version of the app. My goal is to implement a fully-functional version which will allow users to create own paths by
clicking on a map & also implement fully working security & other extras.
